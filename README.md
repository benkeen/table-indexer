#Table Indexer - Prototype Extension

## About
This Prototype extension was written to add a dash of usability to forms arranged in tables. Sometimes, when editing tabulated data, it makes sense for the tab index to go horizontally (the default browser behaviour), so you can edit each field in a row, row by row. Other times, it's more intuitive to edit the data vertically - updating the values in a table, column by column. This module was written to do exactly that: it lets the user toggle between horizontal and vertical tab indexing.
